or
Use the install new software feature of eclipse, use the Add button and
then select the local archive in this folder, eclipse_plugin_archive.zip

or
move the raw plugin to the eclipse (or PROS) plugins folder.
You may then need to restart eclipse with admin privileges before using
as a standard user.
